# My Emacs configuration

A never-ending working in progress, this repository contains my Emacs
configuration which never seem to be done. The current configuration
has strong support for the languages and environments I work with:
* C / C++
* LaTeX (through [AucTeX](https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/))
* R (through [ESS](http://ess.r-project.org/))
* org-mode
* Common Lisp
* JavaScript
* Python

I have some basic configurations for working with Haskell, but I
haven't done much aside from the basics.

Some of the material in my configuration file has been 'inspired' or
simply outright lifted from other more elegant, clever, and
sophisticated set-ups. I will update comments within the files to
reflect this.
